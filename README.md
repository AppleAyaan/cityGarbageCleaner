**###Key Features**
🎲 **Randomized Cleaning Pattern**: The robot navigates in a pre-programmed randomized pattern to cover the cleaning area more thoroughly.
🛠️ **Simple Object Collection Mechanism**: Equipped with a basic collection arm or compartment, the robot gathers rubbish items and stores them as it moves.
🚗 **Enhanced Maneuverability**: The robot’s drive system has been optimized to allow smoother turns, better alignment, and the ability to navigate tighter spaces.
🔋 **Improved Battery Life**: Upgraded power system and efficient motor usage help extend operational time, allowing the robot to clean for longer periods on a single charge.
🧩 **Modular Design**: The robot’s frame and components are modular, making it easy to add, remove, or replace parts for future upgrades.
###**Added Features**
♻️ **Automatic Rubbish Disposal**: An added feature allows the robot to empty its collected rubbish at a designated point. This way, it can resume cleaning without human intervention.
⚙️ **Obstacle Deflection**: While not using sensors, the robot has been configured to deflect and adjust its path upon encountering obstacles.
⏩ **Variable Speed Settings**: Adjust the robot’s speed to either maximize efficiency or prioritize thorough cleaning.
